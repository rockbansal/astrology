	<h1 class="text-success mt-4">Sai Rana Sai, a name given by “Guru”</h1>
	<p>The real name is P K Rana & born in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur. Recently he built some temples also where he born, a village called “chonki patiari”. From the childhood he was had very deep faith in the spiritual things, but presently he was doing engineering business in Mumbai, it is once in his life he met with some very bad accidents, he lose his younger brother and a friend abroad & very heavy loss in business. After it he saw some shadow of some powers. On one day he was sleeping in his Mumbai house alone & in the midnight of Tuesday one lady (spirit type) came and asked that today is your last day on this earth. He feared and not sleeps whole night and very next morning gone to one person who was had some powers, after consulting to him, he directed him to throw some herbal material in the cremation ground. P K Rana had done the same.</p>
	<p>After some two or three days he listened some voice in the midnight that recites “DURGA” mantras.

He started to do that regularly, after it suddenly he met with one Guru in “Varanasi” in India, Guru seen everything and asked P K Rana to go and get check your horoscope from a good Astrologer. He asked to guru, why?</p>
	<p>Guru smiled and asked you have some innate powers with you so that powers are forcing you to do social & spiritual things, and if I am right and then maybe it is in your horoscope also, when I met with one pandit in Punjab he asked me that you had a Guru’s “Mahadasha” so only you should have to do the religious things, it will be better. It will difficult to you to run the business.

After it P K Rana gone to Varanasi and met Guru where guru given him some mantras and after he conceded as his guru wants, guru given him new name as “SAIRANASAI” & blessed to serve the humanity with truthfulness.

Beginner should have to put his whole attention in the beginning to remove of selfishness by prolonged service to the Guru. Serve up your guru with divine (feeling). The evil of individuality will be dissolved.</p>
	<h1 class="text-success">Responsibilities of Guru as well as of followers</h1>
	<p>As a mother of child always alert to newly born child same a thirsting hungry disciple should have to be always alert to serve the guru.

Always serve guru respectfully, cheerfully, unthinkingly, modestly, tirelessly, and devotedly. The energy you expend in serving your guru, thousand times more the divine energy will pour in you.

A follower should serve his guru without a dream of name, fame, power, wealth..

Guru gives mantra to a follower and because he/she symbolize the resilience and life of the given mantra in a constant roots to the Rishimunis (Godly people) who at the beginning of universe researched it, he/she is held in the extreme view in the tantrik rituals.

In the 13th chapter of the popular “Kularnava Tantra” there is no difference between deities, guru & mantra. "Deities are exactness is the same as mantras, mantra in certainty is the same as the guru. The outgrowth of the worship of the deities, mantra and guru is same."</p>
